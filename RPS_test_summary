In the rspec test rock_paper_scissors_spec.rb the test cover each scenario to make sure the correct results are returned. It also check and makes sure the 
correct results are returned for a tie. It makes sure that an exception is raised when illegal characters are used. Here I added a two more checks to make
sure all illegal characters where taken care of including words with the letters in them. The final test makes sure that the tournament is returning the correct
winner once it is fully finished.
