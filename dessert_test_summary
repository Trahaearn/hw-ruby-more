In the Dessert rspec test the test 'cake' and 'apple' check to make sure the methods in the class are working as they are supposed to. The test 'can set' is 
making sure the getters and setters can be accessed and return the right value. The first test I added is 'prevents non-word characters in names' which makes 
sure a dessert name can not have non-word characters in it or have numbers in it. The second test I added is 'prevents bad inputs' which checks to make sure
the exceptions are raised if the name value upon creation it empty or if amount of calories is set below zero.

In the JellyBean rspec test 'when non-licorice' cheks to make sure that the modifed delicious? method remains the same when flavor is not set to licorice. The
'when licorice' test makes sure the modified delicious? mehtod returns false when the flavor is licorice. Then I added a 'can set' test to make sure the flavor
getter and setter were working properly. I also added the test 'prevents non-word characters in flavor names' which makes sure the flavor can not have non-word 
characters in it or have numbers in it. I put the 'prevents bad inputs' test in as well which checks to make sure the exceptions are raised if the flavor value 
upon creation it empty.
